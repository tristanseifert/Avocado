/**
 * This class encapsulates the central CoreData store of the application, and
 * should be accessed via the singleton pattern.
 *
 * For maximum performance, the stack creates various default contexts. The
 * main context (which in turn is the child of the persistent store) runs on a
 * background queue, so all disk IO happens on a separate thread.
 *
 * The main thread context, in turn, is the child of this persistence context.
 * By default, all temporary worker contexts will be children of the main thread
 * context, so that the main thread always has up-to-date data.
