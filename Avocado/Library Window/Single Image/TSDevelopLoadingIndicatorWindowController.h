//
//	A small window that shows a message, as well as a loading indicator,
//	over a vibrant background. It is drawn with a 1pt dark stroke, and
//	does not render a drop shadow.
//
//	This window should be added as a child window for the window on which
//	the indicator is to be displayed. To show the indicator, simply make
//	the window front; to hide it, close it.
