//  Avocado
//
//	This class holds both in-memory representations of cached bitmap
//	data (in floating-point, planar format) as well as handles writing
//	them to the disk transparently. It maintains an internal catalogue
//	of information regarding which caches exist, how large they are, and
//	what images they correspond to.
//
//	When storage becomes low on the system, or the cache becomes too
//	large, the cache will automagically decide which files should be
//	dropped from the cache.
//
//	When storing image planes in the cache, they are automagically kept
//	in memory for as long as feasible; when they are evicted due to
//	memory pressure, or the system is idle, the data is persisted to
//	disk, with some compression applied.

 *		system is under memory pressure.
 *	 2. Loads and decompresses data previously written to disk. This
 *		will take place if the cache contains metadata information
 *		for the given image. In this case, the method will be fully
 *		synchronous. Decompression could take a few seconds, and will
 *		block the calling thread.
 *	 3. Return nil, if no information about the given image could be
 *		found in the metadata cache. This is guaranteed to ocurr only
 *		when `hasDataForUuid:` returns NO.
