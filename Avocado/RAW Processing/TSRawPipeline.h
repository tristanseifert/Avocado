/*
 * The image pipeline takes the raw Bayer data from the sensor, and converts
 * it into usable RGB data that can be processed much more conveniently.
 *
 * Note that up until step 4, data will be in a 16 bit/component unsigned
 * integer (RGB; 48bpp) format; after applying lens corrections, the image
 * buffer is converted to planar 16b floating point RGB. After step 8 is
 * completed, it is converted to chunky 16b floating point RGBX (64bpp).
 *
 *	1. Debayering of RAW data
 *	2. Demosaicing Bayer data
 *		a. Apply white balance
 *		b. Interpolate colour values for missing pixels
 *	3. Apply lens corrections (using LensFun library)
 *		a. Devignetting
 *		b. Geometry corrections (scaling, projection, distortion, chromatic
 *		abberations)
 *	4. vImage gamma correction
 *	5. vImage rotation/flip (to account for flipped status of image)
 *	6. vImage (de)convolution operations
 *	7. vImage 'morphological' operations
 *	8. vImage histogram operations (exposure, contrast, etc.)
 *	9. CoreImage filter pass
 *		a. Noise reduction, blurs
 *		b. Sharpening (luminance, unsharp mask)
 *		c. Colour adjustments and effects
 *		d. Distortion effects
 *		e. Geometry adjustments (crop, scaling, straightening, etc.)
 *		f. Vignetting and grain
 *	10. Generate final histogram (displayed in UI)
 *	11. Display transformations
 *		a. Convert to output (display/sRGB/Adobe RGB) colour space
 *		b. Convert to a different bitmap format
 *
 * The output of stage 5, and stage 10 are cached.
 *
 * Pipeline plugins can chose to process data at any major numbered
 * position in the pipeline. They are called _before_ the built-in pipeline
 * step.
