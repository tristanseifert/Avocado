# Avocado
A native OS X Lightroom alternative, with support for RAW file processing via `LibRaw.`

## Building
The app can be built as normally via Xcode. All dependencies (installed via CocoaPods, and git submodules) must be installed beforehand, however. Several dependencies must also be built, in the following order:

### LibRaw
Execute `./configure --disable-lcms --disable-openmp --disable-static` followed by `make all` in the LibRaw directory. The library is automagically built, and Xcode will link with the dylib.

Note that the `--disable-lcms` flag will disable colour management support in LibRaw; this is not a problem, since we do our own colour management using Cocoa APIs, but this means that all RGB data coming out of LibRaw will be in the sensor colour space.

### gettext
This library is needed as a dependency for Lensfun, as OS X does not ship with gettext by default; as thus, it must be built before Lensfun. To build, change into the directory, then run `./configure --disable-java --disable-native-java --disable-curses --disable-libasprintf --disable-openmp --enable-rpath` followed by `make.`

You will need to acquire the gettext source separately, and place it into the Dependencies folder. gettext-0.19.7 is the version used.

# glib
Because building glib is a _huge_ pain in the ass, a binary copy is provided, as compiled on OS X 10.11 Yosemite. It already has its install name and dependencies fixed so that it actually works.

### Lensfun
Create a directory named cmake_build, change into it, then execute `cmake ..` to create Makefiles. Build as you normally would. The CMakeList file may need to be patched to use `@rpath` for the install name, and to modify the library search path to use our copy of gettext and glib â€” see the `lensfun-patches` directory.

### After all dependencies
Do not forget to execute the `fix_dependencies_rpath.sh` script in the Dependencies folder, after compiling and building any dependencies. This will fix up paths in these libraries so that they can be properly linked, and will not cause a dylib error at runtime.
