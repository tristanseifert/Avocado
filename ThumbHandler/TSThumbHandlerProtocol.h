/**
 * Requests that a thumbnail is generated for the given image. If the thumbnail

 *
 * @param image An image object, containing some pertinent information about it.
 * @param urgent If this parameter is set, it indicates that the user is most
 * likely waiting on the thumbnail (i.e. some list was scrolled, and thumbnails
 * need to be shown) and it should be given a higher priority.
 * @param completionIdentifier Passed as an argument to the delegate when the
 * thumbnail has been generated.
